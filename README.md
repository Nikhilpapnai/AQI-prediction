# Machine Learning Models for AQI Prediction

## 🎯 Objective

This project focuses on evaluating and comparing multiple machine learning models to determine the most accurate method for predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using environmental data.

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

The following regression algorithms were applied and tested:

- **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**

> All models were trained using Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, within the Spyder IDE (Anaconda distribution).

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

To assess and compare model performance, the following error metrics were used:

- **R² Score** (Coefficient of Determination)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **RMSLE** (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error)

---

## 📑 Dataset Source

The dataset was sourced from the [Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India](https://data.gov.in/resources/real-time-air-quality-index-various-locations), which provides hourly AQI readings across multiple Indian cities. Parameters include concentrations of pollutants like:

- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO₂
- SO₂
- CO
- O₃
